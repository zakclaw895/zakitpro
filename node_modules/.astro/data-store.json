Windows Autopilot lets you take a brand-new PC straight from the box and transform it into a fully managed, ready-to-use machine — without ever touching it in your IT lab.\n\nIn this first part of our series, we'll cover everything you need before you can start using Autopilot.\n\n## What is Windows Autopilot?\n\nThink of Autopilot as the \"magic button\" for new devices. Instead of imaging computers manually (loading Windows onto each one, installing apps, configuring settings), Autopilot handles all of that automatically when a user first turns on their new PC.\n\n**Why IT teams love it:**\n- No need for imaging labs or USB drives\n- Less hands-on time per device\n- Consistent configuration across your organization\n\n**Why users love it:**\n- Faster setup — they're productive quicker\n- Simple, guided experience\n- They get a professionally configured machine from day one\n\n## What You Need Before Starting\n\nBefore you can use Autopilot, make sure you have these prerequisites in place:\n\n### 1. The Right Microsoft Licenses\n\nYou need one of the following:\n- **Microsoft 365 Business Premium** (includes everything)\n- **Intune Plan 1 or Plan 2** (standalone)\n- **Microsoft 365 E3/E5** with Intune\n\n> 💡 **Tip:** Microsoft 365 Business Premium is the easiest starting point — it includes Intune, Azure AD, and all the features you need.\n\n### 2. Azure AD Premium (Included)\n\nAutopilot requires Azure Active Directory (now called Microsoft Entra ID) to join devices. This is included with M365 Business Premium, or you need Azure AD P1/P2 for standalone Intune.\n\n### 3. Windows Version\n\nYour devices must run:\n- **Windows 10** (version 1809 or later) or\n- **Windows 11**\n\nThe Windows edition should be **Pro** or **Enterprise** (Home won't work for Autopilot enrollment).\n\n### 4. An Admin Account\n\nYou'll need an account with one of these roles:\n- **Global Administrator** (full access)\n- **Intune Administrator** (manages Intune only)\n- **Device Enrollment Manager** (specifically for enrolling devices)\n\n## Step-by-Step: Check Your M365 Licenses\n\nLet's verify you have Intune available in your tenant.\n\n1. Go to the **[Microsoft 365 Admin Center](https://admin.microsoft.com)**\n2. Navigate to **Billing → Your products**\n3. Look for your subscription and verify **Intune** is listed\n\n> **Screenshot:** *Microsoft 365 Admin Center dashboard showing licenses*\n\nIf you don't see Intune, you may need to add it or upgrade your subscription.\n\n## Step-by-Step: Enable Device Enrollment\n\nNow let's make sure devices can actually enroll in Intune.\n\n1. Open the **[Microsoft Endpoint Manager admin center](https://endpoint.microsoft.com)**\n2. Go to **Devices → Enrollment**\n3. Click on **Enrollment options**\n\n> **Screenshot:** *Endpoint Manager enrollment page*\n\nHere you can configure:\n- **MDM authority** — set this to \"Intune\" (it usually is by default)\n- **MAM user scope** — decide who can enroll devices\n- **Device enrollment restrictions** — set limits on who can enroll what types of devices\n\n> ⚠️ **Warning:** Don't disable enrollment unless you have a specific reason — you won't be able to deploy new devices!\n\n## Step-by-Step: Verify Azure AD Device Settings\n\nAutopilot devices join Azure AD, so let's check your tenant settings.\n\n1. Go to the **[Microsoft Endpoint Manager admin center](https://endpoint.microsoft.com)**\n2. Navigate to **Devices → Azure AD devices**\n3. Click on **Device settings**\n\n> **Screenshot:** *Azure AD device settings page*\n\nCheck that:\n- **Users may join devices to Azure AD** is set to \"All\" or a specific group\n- **Maximum number of devices per user** is appropriate for your organization\n- **Device sync** is enabled\n\n## Account Setup Checklist\n\nBefore moving on to Part 2, verify you've completed these items:\n\n- [ ] Global Admin or Intune Admin account ready\n- [ ] User with Device Enrollment Manager role (optional but helpful)\n- [ ] Azure AD tenant configured and working\n- [ ] At least a few test users created in Azure AD\n- [ ] Microsoft 365 subscription with Intune enabled\n\n> 💡 **Tip:** Create a dedicated \"test user\" account in Azure AD — you'll use this to test your Autopilot deployments before rolling out to real employees.\n\n## What's Next?\n\nOnce your prerequisites are in place, you're ready for Part 2: **Registering your first device and creating deployment profiles**. We'll show you how to get the hardware hash from a device and import it into Intune.\n\n**Questions?** Drop a comment below if anything in this guide wasn't clear!","src/content/articles/autopilot-part-1-prerequisites.mdx","8350effff964a156","autopilot-part-1-prerequisites.mdx","active-directory-group-management",{"id":46,"data":48,"body":57,"filePath":58,"digest":59,"legacyId":60,"deferredRender":24},{"title":49,"description":50,"publishedAt":18,"pillar":17,"difficulty":34,"type":51,"tags":52,"draft":19},"Active Directory Group Management Scripts","PowerShell scripts for managing Active Directory groups.

Now it's time to register your first device in Intune and create a deployment profile that tells Autopilot how to configure new PCs.\n\nLet's dive in!\n\n## Understanding the Hardware Hash\n\nBefore we register a device, you need to understand what Autopilot actually needs. Each Windows device has a unique identifier called a **hardware hash** — a long string of characters that identifies that specific machine.\n\nAutopilot uses this hash to:\n1. Identify the device uniquely\n2. Look up which profile to apply\n3. Enroll it in your Intune tenant\n\n> 💡 **Tip:** Think of the hardware hash like a serial number that Intune uses to recognize and claim the device.\n\n## Method 1: Automatic Registration (From OEM)\n\nIf you're buying new devices from major manufacturers like Dell, HP, or Lenovo, you can skip the manual registration! These OEMs automatically submit their devices to Microsoft, and you can claim them in Intune.\n\n**How to claim OEM devices:**\n1. Go to **Devices → Windows → Windows devices** in Endpoint Manager\n2. Click **Add** and select **Search OEM devices**\n3. The devices will appear — just claim them!\n\nThis is the easiest method for purchasing new hardware.\n\n## Method 2: Manual Registration (Using PowerShell)\n\nFor testing, used devices, or devices not registered by an OEM, you'll need to gather the hardware hash manually.\n\n### Step 1: Install the AutoPilot Script\n\nOn the Windows device you want to register (it should be running Windows 10/11 and have network access):\n\n```powershell\n# Open PowerShell as Administrator and run:\nInstall-Script -Name Get-WindowsAutoPilotInfo -Scope CurrentUser\n```\n\nWhen prompted to install NuGet, type **Y** and press Enter.\n\n### Step 2: Generate the Hardware Hash\n\nNow run the script to capture the hardware hash:\n\n```powershell\n# Generate the CSV file\nGet-WindowsAutoPilotInfo -Computer . -OutputFile autopilot.csv\n```\n\n> **Screenshot:** *PowerShell script running and generating the CSV file*\n\nThis creates a file called `autopilot.csv` in your current folder. Open it — you should see something like:\n\n> **Screenshot:** *Contents of autopilot.csv showing hardware hash, serial number, etc.*\n\nThe CSV contains:\n- **Device Serial Number**\n- **Windows Product ID**\n- **Hardware Hash** (the important part!)\n- **Make/Model**\n\n## Step-by-Step: Import Devices to Intune\n\nNow let's get that CSV into Intune.\n\n1. Open the **[Microsoft Endpoint Manager admin center](https://endpoint.microsoft.com)**\n2. Go to **Devices → Windows → Windows devices**\n3. Click **Add**\n4. Select **Import Windows devices**\n\n> **Screenshot:** *Intune device import page*\n\n5. Click **Browse** and select your `autopilot.csv` file\n6. Click **Import**\n\n> **Screenshot:** *Upload CSV file to Intune*\n\nWait a minute or two for the import to complete. You should see a success message when done.\n\n> 💡 **Tip:** You can import multiple devices at once — just add more rows to your CSV file!\n\n## Create an Autopilot Deployment Profile\n\nNow for the magic — the deployment profile tells Autopilot how to set up the device. Let's create one.\n\n1. In Endpoint Manager, go to **Devices → Windows → Autopilot deployment profiles**\n2. Click **Create profile**\n3. Select **Windows PC**\n\n> **Screenshot:** *Profile creation wizard - getting started*\n\n### Step 1: Basics\n\nFill in the basics:\n- **Name:** `Standard User Profile` (or whatever makes sense)\n- **Description:** `Default profile for standard user devices`\n\nClick **Next**.\n\n### Step 2: Out-of-Box Experience (OOBE)\n\nThis is where you configure what the user sees during setup:\n\n| Setting | Recommended Value | Why |\n|---------|-------------------|-----|\n| Deployment mode | User-driven | User sets up their own device |\n| Join to | Azure AD joined | Modern cloud management |\n| Language (OS) | Match hardware | Uses the keyboard/language detected |\n| Hide change account options | Yes | Keeps experience simple |\n| Hide privacy settings | Yes | Reduces user clicks |\n| Skip Cortana | Yes | Faster setup |\n| OEM Registration | Skip | We're using Intune |\n| Auto-logon | Disable | Security best practice |\n\n> **Screenshot:** *Profile creation wizard - OOBE settings*\n\nFor **Keyboard**, you can:\n- Leave blank (uses detected keyboard)\n- Add a primary keyboard (e.g., US English)\n- Add a login keyboard if different\n\nClick **Next** → **Create** to save your profile.\n\n> **Screenshot:** *Profile created successfully*\n\n## Assign the Profile to Devices\n\nYour profile is created, but it's not attached to any devices yet. Let's fix that.\n\n1. Go to **Devices → Windows → Autopilot deployment profiles**\n2. Select your new profile\n3. Click **Assign**\n\n> **Screenshot:** *Assignment blade*\n\n4. Choose one of these options:\n   - **Select groups** — assign to a specific Azure AD group\n   - **All devices** — every Autopilot device gets this profile\n\n> 💡 **Tip:** For testing, create a small Azure AD group called \"Autopilot Test Devices\" and assign only a few devices to it. This lets you validate before rolling out to everyone.\n\n> **Screenshot:** *Profile assigned to devices*\n\n## Verify the Assignment\n\nAfter assigning, your devices should show up in the profile's device list. You can check this by:\n1. Opening the profile\n2. Looking at the **Devices** tab\n\nIt may take a few minutes for the assignment to propagate.\n\n## Quick Recap\n\nIn this part, you learned:\n- ✅ What a hardware hash is\n- ✅ How to get the hardware hash using PowerShell\n- ✅ How to import devices into Intune\n- ✅ How to create an Autopilot deployment profile\n- ✅ How to assign the profile to devices\n\n## What's Next?\n\nIn [Part 3](/autopilot-part-3-testing-troubleshooting), we'll actually test the deployment, verify the device enrolls correctly, and troubleshoot common issues that might come up.\n\n**Questions?** Let me know in the comments!","src/content/articles/autopilot-part-2-registration-profiles.mdx","6510403ff8a7475c","autopilot-part-2-registration-profiles.mdx","autopilot-part-3-testing-troubleshooting",{"id":72,"data":74,"body":79,"filePath":80,"digest":81,"legacyId":82,"deferredRender":24},{"title":75,"description":76,"publishedAt":32,"pillar":33,"difficulty":34,"type":35,"tags":77,"seriesId":40,"seriesPart":78,"draft":19},"Windows Autopilot Part 3: Testing & Troubleshooting","Test your Autopilot deployment, verify device enrollment, and fix common issues.",[37,38,33,39],3,"Congratulations! You've set up your prerequisites, registered devices, and created deployment profiles. Now it's time for the moment of truth — actually testing your Autopilot deployment.\n\nIn this final part, we'll walk through what to expect, verify everything works, and troubleshoot any issues.\n\n## What Happens When a User First Turns On the Device\n\nWhen a user unpacks a new Autopilot-configured PC and turns it on, here's the journey they go through:\n\n1. **Welcome Screen** — Language and keyboard selection\n2. **Network Connection** — Connect to WiFi or Ethernet\n3. **Sign In** — Enter their Azure AD credentials\n4. **Enrollment** — Intune configures the device (this happens automatically!)\n5. **Desktop** — User lands on a ready-to-use machine\n\n> **Screenshot:** *OOBE welcome screen*\n\n> **Screenshot:** *User sign-in page*\n\n> **Screenshot:** *Enrollment in progress*\n\n> **Screenshot:** *Desktop ready*\n\n> 💡 **Tip:** This entire process typically takes 10-20 minutes depending on network speed and how many policies you deploy.\n\n## Step-by-Step: Test Your First Device\n\n### 1. Reset the Device (If Previously Used)\n\nIf you're testing with a device that's been used before, you'll want to reset it first:\n\n```powershell\n# On the test device, run as Administrator:\nWindows + I → Recovery → Reset PC → Remove everything → Local reinstall\n```\n\nOr use the **Intune Wipe** command from Endpoint Manager if the device is already enrolled.\n\n### 2. Go Through OOBE\n\nPower on the device and walk through the out-of-box experience:\n\n1. Select your language and keyboard layout\n2. Connect to the internet (WiFi or Ethernet)\n3. When prompted, enter the Azure AD credentials of a test user\n4. Wait while enrollment completes\n5. You're on the desktop!\n\n### 3. Verify Device Appears in Intune\n\nNow let's confirm everything worked on the management side.\n\n1. Open the **[Microsoft Endpoint Manager admin center](https://endpoint.microsoft.com)**\n2. Go to **Devices → All devices**\n3. Look for your test device\n\n> **Screenshot:** *Device appearing in Intune*\n\nClick on the device to see its details:\n\n> **Screenshot:** *Device details page*\n\nCheck these things:\n- ✅ **Enrollment status:** Should show \"Enrolled\"\n- ✅ **Last sync time:** Should be recent\n- ✅ **Compliance status:** Should be \"Compliant\" (or \"Not evaluated\" briefly after enrollment)\n- ✅ **Join type:** Should show \"Azure AD joined\"\n\n> 💡 **Tip:** If the device doesn't appear immediately, click **Sync** to force a refresh.\n\n## Deploy Your First Policy\n\nNow that your device is enrolled, let's verify you can actually manage it by deploying a simple policy.\n\n### Example: Rename the Computer Automatically\n\nLet's create a configuration profile that renames the enrolled computer.\n\n1. In Endpoint Manager, go to **Devices → Configuration profiles**\n2. Click **Create profile**\n3. Select **Windows 10 and later**\n4. Choose **Settings catalog** (or use a template)\n\n> **Screenshot:** *Create configuration profile*\n\nFor this example, let's use the **Device rename** template:\n\n1. Search for \"device rename\" in settings\n2. Configure the rename rule:\n   - **Name pattern:** `{first}-{serial}` (e.g., \"zak-DELL1234\")\n   - **Action:** Update\n\n3. Assign to your test device or group\n\n> **Screenshot:** *Configure device rename policy*\n\n4. Click **Create**\n\n### Trigger a Sync\n\nAfter creating the policy, you need to push it to the device:\n\n1. Go to **Devices → All devices**\n2. Select your test device\n3. Click **Sync**\n\n> 💡 **Tip:** Wait 5-10 minutes for the policy to apply. The device checks in periodically.\n\n### Verify the Rename\n\nOn your test device:\n1. Open **Settings → System → About**\n2. Check if the device name has changed to your new pattern!\n\n## Common Issues & How to Fix Them\n\nDon't panic if things don't work perfectly the first time. Here are the most common Autopilot issues and their solutions.\n\n### Issue: \"Profile Not Found\" Error\n\n**What you see:** During OOBE, the device says it can't find an Autopilot profile.\n\n**Cause:** The profile hasn't been assigned to the device or group.\n\n**Fix:**\n1. Go to **Devices → Windows → Autopilot deployment profiles**\n2. Open your profile\n3. Click **Assign**\n4. Make sure the device or its group is selected\n\n> **Screenshot:** *Profile assignment error*\n\n### Issue: Enrollment Failed\n\n**What you see:** \"Enrollment failed\" or similar error during setup.\n\n**Cause:** Usually a license issue — the user doesn't have an Intune license.\n\n**Fix:**\n1. Check the user's license in **Microsoft 365 Admin Center**\n2. Ensure they have Intune or M365 Business Premium\n3. Assign the license if missing\n\n### Issue: Can't Join Azure AD\n\n**What you see:** Device can't connect to Azure AD during enrollment.\n\n**Cause:** Network issues or Azure AD settings.\n\n**Fix:**\n1. Verify the device has internet access\n2. Check **Devices → Azure AD devices → Device settings** in Endpoint Manager\n3. Ensure \"Users may join devices to Azure AD\" is enabled\n4. Check that the user isn't hitting device limits\n\n### Issue: Device Not Appearing After Import\n\n**What you see:** You imported the CSV but the device doesn't show up anywhere.\n\n**Cause:** The hardware hash might be incorrect or the import failed silently.\n\n**Fix:**\n1. Go to **Devices → Windows → Windows devices**\n2. Check for import errors\n3. Re-run the PowerShell script and re-import\n4. Make sure the CSV format is correct (no extra headers or columns)\n\n### Issue: Policy Not Applying\n\n**What you see:** You created a policy but it hasn't reached the device.\n\n**Cause:** Timing or assignment issues.\n\n**Fix:**\n1. Check **Device status** in the policy details\n2. Verify the device is in the assigned group\n3. Click **Sync** on the device\n4. Wait — it can take up to 24 hours but usually faster\n\n> 💡 **Tip:** Most issues resolve by having the device **sync** or by **restarting** the device.\n\n## Next Steps: Where Do You Go From Here?\n\nYou've completed the Autopilot basics! Here's where to explore next:\n\n### 1. Add More Devices\n- Register your organization's real devices\n- Consider buying from OEMs who pre-register (less work!)\n\n### 2. Explore Self-Deploying Mode\n- For kiosk, digital signage, or shared devices\n- No user login required — device automatically enrolls\n\n### 3. Set Up Device Groups\n- Create dynamic groups based on device attributes\n- Target policies more precisely\n\n### 4. Configure Compliance Policies\n- Set requirements for what makes a device \"healthy\"\n- Block access if devices aren't compliant\n\n### 5. Application Deployment\n- Push apps automatically during enrollment\n- Configure required apps that install silently\n\n## Quick Recap\n\nIn this series, you learned:\n- ✅ **Part 1:** Prerequisites, licenses, and account setup\n- ✅ **Part 2:** Registering devices and creating deployment profiles\n- ✅ **Part 3:** Testing deployments and troubleshooting common issues\n\nYou're now ready to deploy Windows devices with Autopilot in your organization!\n\n**Have questions or run into issues?** Drop a comment below and I'll help you figure it out.","src/content/articles/autopilot-part-3-testing-troubleshooting.mdx","3498dce5b6b880b9","autopilot-part-3-testing-troubleshooting.mdx","bitlocker-recovery-keys-guide",{"id":83,"data":85,"body":95,"filePath":96,"digest":97,"legacyId":98,"deferredRender":24},{"title":86,"description":87,"publishedAt":18,"pillar":88,"difficulty":89,"type":35,"tags":90,"draft":19},"BitLocker Recovery Keys: The Complete Guide","Managing BitLocker recovery keys in enterprise environments. Backup, recovery, and automation with Intune.","security","mid",[91,92,93,38,94],"bitlocker","encryption","recovery","tpm","# BitLocker Recovery Keys: The Complete Guide\n\nBitLocker is essential for endpoint security, but if you lose the recovery keys, you're in trouble. This guide covers everything about managing BitLocker recovery keys in enterprise environments.\n\n## The Problem\n\nYou encrypt a machine with BitLocker, the user forgets their PIN, the TPM resets, or the machine reboots after a BIOS update — and suddenly you need the recovery key.\n\n**If you don't have it backed up, you're locked out. Permanently.**\n\n## Where Recovery Keys Are Stored\n\n### 1. Active Directory (Best Option)\n\n```powershell\n# Enable BitLocker key backup to AD\n# Via Group Policy:\n# Computer Configuration → Administrative Templates → Windows Components → BitLocker Drive Encryption → Store BitLocker recovery information in Active Directory Domain Services\n\n# Enable for domain members\nSet-ItemProperty -Path \"HKLM:\\SOFTWARE\\Policies\\Microsoft\\FVE\" -Name \"ADBackedUp\" -Value 1 -Type DWord\n```\n\n### 2. Intune\n\n```powershell\n# In Intune:\n# Devices → Configuration profiles → Create → Endpoint protection → BitLocker\n\n# Enable key escrow\n# Settings: Select \"Store recovery keys in Intune\"\n```\n\n### 3. Azure AD\n\nAutomatically backed up when:\n- Device is Azure AD joined\n- User has correct licenses\n\n## How to Recover Keys\n\n### From Intune\n\n1. Go to **Microsoft Endpoint Manager**\n2. **Devices** → **All devices**\n3. Select the device\n4. Click **BitLocker recovery keys**\n\n```powershell\n# Via Graph API\nGet-MgDeviceManagementManagedDeviceBitLockerRecoveryKey -ManagedDeviceId $DeviceID\n```\n\n### From Active Directory\n\n```powershell\n# Using ADUC (Active Directory Users and Computers)\n# View → Advanced Features\n# Find computer object → Properties → BitLocker Recovery tab\n```\n\n### From Backup (8-digit ID)\n\nIf user has the 8-digit numerical ID:\n\n```powershell\n# In Intune recovery blade\n# Enter the 8-digit ID to retrieve the key\n```\n\n## Automating Key Backup\n\n### Script: Export Keys to SharePoint\n\n```powershell\n\u003C#\n.SYNOPSIS\n    Export BitLocker keys to CSV\n#>\n\n$OutputFile = \"$env:TEMP\\BitLockerKeys_$(Get-Date -Format 'yyyyMMdd').csv\"\n\n# Get all devices with BitLocker\n$Devices = Get-MgDeviceManagementManagedDevice -Filter \"bitLockerEnabled eq true\" -All\n\n$Results = @()\n\nforeach ($Device in $Devices) {\n    $Keys = Get-MgDeviceManagementManagedDeviceBitLockerRecoveryKey -ManagedDeviceId $Device.Id -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue\n    \n    foreach ($Key in $Keys) {\n        $Results += [PSCustomObject]@{\n            DeviceName = $Device.DeviceName\n            DeviceID = $Device.AzureADDeviceID\n            KeyID = $Key.Id\n            RecoveryKey = $Key.BitLockerRecoveryKey\n            CreatedDate = $Key.CreatedDateTime\n        }\n    }\n}\n\n$Results | Export-Csv -Path $OutputFile -NoTypeInformation\nWrite-Host \"Exported to: $OutputFile\"\n```\n\n## Preventing Lockouts\n\n### 1. Save Recovery Keys EARLY\n\n```powershell\n# Script to save key during encryption\n$tpm = Get-Tpm\nif ($tvm.TpmPresent -and $tpm.TpmReady) {\n    Enable-BitLocker -MountPoint \"C:\" -EncryptionMethod XtsAes256 -UsedSpaceOnly -TpmProtector\n    \n    # Save recovery key locally as backup\n    $Key = Get-BitLockerVolume -MountPoint \"C:\" | Select-Object -ExpandProperty KeyProtector | Where-Object { $_.KeyProtectorType -eq \"RecoveryPassword\" }\n    \n    # Export to secure location\n    $Key.RecoveryPassword | Out-File \"C:\\BitLocker\\$env:USERNAME-Recovery.txt\"\n}\n```\n\n### 2. Configure TPM Properly\n\n```powershell\n# Check TPM status\nGet-Tpm\n\n# Clear TPM if needed (WARNING: may cause BitLocker to require recovery)\nClear-Tpm -AllowClear\n```\n\n### 3. Set Up MBAM (Microsoft BitLocker Administration and Monitoring)\n\nFor larger enterprises, MBAM provides:\n- Self-service portal\n- Admin key recovery\n- Compliance reporting\n\n## Common Errors\n\n### \"The operation could not be completed because the BitLocker protection software could not be enabled\"\n\n- Disable Secure Boot temporarily\n- Check TPM is enabled in BIOS\n- Update chipset/BIOS firmware\n\n### \"This PC doesn't support BitLocker\"\n\n- Check TPM version (must be 1.2+)\n- Check if Pro/Enterprise edition\n- Check Group Policy blocking\n\n## Quick Checklist\n\n- [ ] Keys backed up to AD or Intune\n- [ ] Users know their 8-digit ID\n- [ ] Self-service recovery portal configured\n- [ ] Documented recovery process for helpdesk\n- [ ] Test recovery before you need it\n\n## Wrap-Up\n\nBitLocker recovery keys are not optional in enterprise. Back them up, test recovery, and have a process.\n\nQuestions?

Here's the complete guide.\n\n## Why Win32?\n\n- **Bigger apps** — Up to 8GB per app\n- **Custom installs** — Any installer type\n- **Requirements** — Check prerequisites before install\n- **Detection** — Multiple ways to verify install\n\n## The Two Tools You Need\n\n### 1. Microsoft Win32 Content Prep Tool\nDownload from: https://github.com/microsoft/Microsoft-Win32-Content-Prep-Tool\n\n### 2. IntuneWinAppUtil.exe\n```powershell\n# Convert installer to .intunewin\n.\\IntuneWinAppUtil.exe -c C:\\Apps\\7zip -s 7zip-x64.exe -o C:\\Apps\\Output\n```\n\n## Step-by-Step Deployment\n\n### Step 1: Prepare the App\n\n```powershell\n# Create output folder\nNew-Item -ItemType Directory -Path C:\\Apps\\Output -Force\n\n# Run the prep tool\n# This creates a .intunewin file with detection logic\n```\n\n### Step 2: Upload to Intune\n\n1. Go to **Apps** → **Windows** → **Add**\n2. Select **Windows app (win32)**\n3. Upload your `.intunewin` file\n\n### Step 3: Configure Install/Uninstall\n\n```powershell\n# Install command\n# Example for 7-Zip:\n\"7zip-x64.exe /S\"\n\n# Uninstall command\n# Check in registry:\nHKLM\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Uninstall\\7-Zip\n```\n\n### Step 4: Set Requirements\n\n| Requirement | Use When |\n|-------------|----------|\n| OS version | App requires specific Windows version |\n| Architecture | x86 vs x64 apps |\n| RAM | Minimum memory needed |\n| Disk space | Required free space |\n| File/Folder exists | Prerequisite app installed |\n| Registry value | Previous app version |\n\n### Step 5: Detection Rules\n\nChoose how Intune knows the app is installed:\n\n| Method | Best For |\n|--------|----------|\n| MSI product code | MSI installers |\n| File exists | EXE-based apps |\n| Registry key | Apps with registry entries |\n| Script | Complex detection |\n\n```powershell\n# Example: File detection\nPath: C:\\Program Files\\7-Zip\\7zFM.exe\nDetection method: File or folder exists\n```\n\n### Step 6: Assign to Users/Devices\n\n- **Required** — Auto-install\n- **Available** — User self-service\n- **Uninstall** — Remove from devices\n\n## Troubleshooting\n\n### App Not Installing\n\n```powershell\n# Check Intune logs\n$LogPath = \"$env:ProgramData\\Microsoft\\Intune\\Logs\\MDMMgmt.log\"\nGet-Content $LogPath -Tail 100\n\n# Check Win32 app logs\n$IntuneLog = \"$env:TEMP\\IntuneApps.log\"\n```\n\n### Detection Rule Not Working\n\n```powershell\n# Test detection manually\nTest-Path \"C:\\Program Files\\AppName\\app.exe\"\n\n# Check registry\nGet-ItemProperty \"HKLM:\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Uninstall\\AppName\"\n```\n\n## Pro Tips\n\n1. **Always test in audit mode first**\n2. **Use requirements to prevent failures**\n3. **Create detection rules from uninstall strings**\n4. **Document install/uninstall commands**\n\n## Wrap-Up\n\nWin32 apps give you the most control in Intune.

Step-by-step troubleshooting for the most common permission issues.",[38,152,189,190,133],"access-denied","permissions","# Fix Intune Access Denied Errors\n\nYou're trying to deploy an app, create a policy, or sync a device in Microsoft Intune, and suddenly you hit **\"Access Denied.\"** It's one of the most frustrating errors because it usually means something is broken in your permission chain — and the error message rarely tells you *what*.\n\nIn this guide, I'll walk you through the most common causes of Access Denied in Intune and how to fix them.\n\n## The Problem\n\nYou log into the Microsoft Endpoint Manager admin center, try to create a configuration profile, assign a policy, or even just view device details, and you get:\n\n> **Access Denied. You don't have permission to access this resource.**\n\nSometimes it affects everything, sometimes just specific actions. Let's dig in.\n\n## Cause #1: Missing Role Assignments\n\nThe most common cause. Intune uses Role-Based Access Control (RBAC), and if your account isn't assigned the right role, you're locked out.\n\n### How to Check\n\n1. Go to **Microsoft Endpoint Manager** → **Admin centers** → **Microsoft Endpoint Manager admin center**\n2. Navigate to **Tenant administration** → **Roles** → **All roles**\n3. Find your role or check what roles you have assigned\n\n### The Fix\n\n1. Go to **Tenant administration** → **Users** → Select your user\n2. Check **Intune role** assignments\n3. Add a built-in role like **Intune Administrator** or **Policy and Profile Manager**\n\n> **Screenshot placeholder:** *Show Intune role assignment blade*\n\n## Cause #2: Scope Tags Misconfiguration\n\nScope tags restrict what resources you can manage. Even with the right role, if you don't have the right scope tag, Access Denied.\n\n### How to Check\n\n1. Go to **Tenant administration** → **Roles** → **All roles**\n2. Open your assigned role\n3. Look at the **Scope (Tags)** section\n\n### The Fix\n\n- Either assign the scope tag that contains your target devices/profiles\n- Or create a custom role without scope tag restrictions\n\n```powershell\n# Quick check: What scope tags do I have?\nGet-MgDeviceManagementRoleAssignment -Filter \"principalId eq '$((Get-MgUser -UserId $env:USERNAME).id)'\" | \n    Select-Object RoleDefinitionName, ScopeTags\n```\n\n> **Screenshot placeholder:** *Show scope tag configuration*\n\n## Cause #3: Incorrect License Assignment\n\nYou need an Intune license to manage devices. Without it, you can't access the admin center properly.\n\n### The Fix\n\n1. Go to **Microsoft 365 admin center** → **Users** → **Active users**\n2. Select your account\n3. Verify **Intune (Plan 1)** or **Microsoft Intune Plan 2** is assigned\n\n```powershell\n# Check license via Graph\nGet-MgUserLicenseDetail -UserId $env:USERNAME | \n    Where-Object { $_.ServicePlans | Where-Object { $_.ServicePlanName -like \"*Intune*\" }}\n```\n\n## Cause #4: Conditional Access Policies Blocking Access\n\nConditional Access policies can lock you out of the Endpoint Manager portal if they exclude the admin accounts incorrectly.\n\n### The Fix\n\n1. Go to **Microsoft Entra ID** → **Security** → **Conditional Access**\n2. Look for policies targeting \"Microsoft Intune\" or \"Endpoint Manager\"\n3. Check the **Exclude** list — make sure your admin account isn't excluded inappropriately\n\n> **Warning:** Be careful not to lock yourself out completely!\n\n## Cause #5: Graph API Permissions (For Automation)\n\nIf you're using PowerShell scripts or automation (like the examples in this blog), you need the right API permissions.\n\n### The Fix\n\nIf using Azure AD App registrations:\n- **DeviceManagementManagedDevices.Read.All**\n- **DeviceManagementConfiguration.ReadWrite.All**\n- **DeviceManagementServiceConfiguration.ReadWrite.All**\n\n```powershell\n# Test Graph access\nConnect-MgGraph -Scopes \"DeviceManagementManagedDevices.Read.All\"\nGet-MgDeviceManagementManagedDevice -Top 1\n```\n\n## Cause #6: Device-Specific Block Issues\n\nSometimes Access Denied appears when trying to:\n- Wipe a device\n- Retire a device  \n- Push apps to a specific device\n\n### The Fix\n\n1. Check if the device is **blocked** in Intune\n2. Verify the device record exists and isn't orphaned\n3. Check if the user has been removed from Azure AD (orphaned device)\n\n```powershell\n# Find the device and check its status\nGet-MgDeviceManagementManagedDevice -Filter \"deviceName eq 'TARGETDEVICE'\" |\n    Select-Object DeviceName, UserId, EnrollmentState, DeviceRegistrationPolicy\n```\n\n## Quick Troubleshooting Checklist\n\n1. ✅ Do you have an Intune license?\n2. ✅ Are you assigned an Intune role?\n3. ✅ Does that role have the right permissions?\n4. ✅ Does the role include the right scope tags?\n5. ✅ Any Conditional Access policies blocking portal access?\n6. ✅ Is this a Graph API permission issue?\n\n## Wrap-Up\n\nAccess Denied in Intune is almost always a permission problem. Start with role assignments, check scope tags, verify licenses, and work your way through the list above.\n\nNeed help?

Whether you're managing Windows endpoints, automating Active Directory tasks, or querying Microsoft Graph, PowerShell is the backbone of modern Windows administration.\n\n## Why PowerShell?\n\nAs an IT desktop engineer, you'll encounter PowerShell in various scenarios:\n\n- **Intune/Endpoint Manager** — Device management via Microsoft Graph\n- **Active Directory** — User and group management\n- **Office 365** — Exchange, SharePoint, and Teams administration\n- **Automation** — Scheduled tasks and CI/CD pipelines\n\n## Prerequisites\n\nBefore diving in, ensure you have:\n\n1. Windows 10/11 or Windows Server 2019+\n2. PowerShell 5.1 or higher (7.x recommended)\n3. VS Code with PowerShell extension\n\n## Your First Script\n\nLet's create a simple script to gather system information:\n\n```powershell\n# Get-SystemInfo.ps1\n# System Information Gatherer\n\n$ComputerInfo = @{\n    ComputerName = $env:COMPUTERNAME\n    OS = (Get-CimInstance -ClassName Win32_OperatingSystem).Caption\n    Version = (Get-CimInstance -ClassName Win32_OperatingSystem).Version\n    LastBoot = (Get-CimInstance -ClassName Win32_OperatingSystem).LastBootUpTime\n    Uptime = ((Get-Date) - (Get-CimInstance -ClassName Win32_OperatingSystem).LastBootUpTime).ToString()\n}\n\n$ComputerInfo | ConvertTo-Json\n```\n\n### Running the Script\n\nSave the code above as `Get-SystemInfo.ps1` and run:\n\n```powershell\n.\\Get-SystemInfo.ps1\n```\n\n## Understanding the Pipeline\n\nOne of PowerShell's most powerful features is the pipeline:\n\n```powershell\n# Get all processes using more than 100MB of memory\nGet-Process | \n    Where-Object { $_.WorkingSet64 -gt 100MB } | \n    Sort-Object WorkingSet64 -Descending | \n    Select-Object -First 10 Name, @{N='MemoryMB';E={[math]::Round($_.WorkingSet64/1MB,2)}}\n```\n\n## Working with Objects\n\nEverything in PowerShell is an object. This makes it incredibly powerful:\n\n```powershell\n# Get the current date as an object\nGet-Date\n\n# Access properties\n(Get-Date).DayOfWeek\n\n# Call methods\n(Get-Date).AddDays(7)\n```\n\n## Best Practices\n\n1. **Always use -WhatIf** for destructive operations\n2. **Use strict mode** with `Set-StrictMode -Version Latest`\n3. **Comment your code** — Future you will thank present you\n4. **Use verbs from the approved list** — Get, Set, New, Remove, etc.\n\n## Next Steps\n\nIn future articles, we'll cover:\n\n- Working with APIs (REST endpoints)\n- Graph API authentication\n- Building modular scripts\n- Error handling\n- Creating scheduled tasks\n\nStay tuned!\n\n```powershell\n# Quick test - run this to verify PowerShell is working\nWrite-Host \"PowerShell is working!\" -ForegroundColor Green\n```","src/content/articles/getting-started-with-powershell.mdx","1d0806e79f403e6b","getting-started-with-powershell.mdx","intune-device-restriction-profiles",{"id":207,"data":209,"body":215,"filePath":216,"digest":217,"legacyId":218,"deferredRender":24},{"title":210,"description":211,"publishedAt":18,"pillar":88,"difficulty":34,"type":35,"tags":212,"draft":19},"Intune Device Restriction Profiles Explained","Complete guide to Intune device restriction profiles.

Get your endpoints back to a managed state quickly.",[38,264,265,266,133],"sync","stuck","endpoint-manager","# Fix Intune Stuck in Sync Loop\n\nYou check your Intune console and see it — a device that's been \"Syncing\" for hours. Or maybe it syncs successfully, but the policies you deployed just won't apply. This is one of the most common issues in endpoint management, and in this guide, I'll show you exactly how to fix it.\n\n## The Symptoms\n\n- Device shows \"Sync in progress\" for hours/days\n- Policies don't apply even though deployment shows successful\n- Device appears in console but shows stale last check-in time\n- User complains their machine \"isn't getting updates\"\n\n## Why This Happens\n\nThe sync loop usually breaks because:\n1. **Network issues** blocking the check-in\n2. **Policy conflicts** causing the service to retry endlessly\n3. **Corrupted registry/certificates** on the device\n4. **Intune Service Synchronization Certificate** expired\n\nLet's fix it.\n\n## Method 1: Remote Sync from Intune Console\n\nThe easiest fix — try forcing a sync from the admin center.\n\n1. Go to **Devices** → **All devices**\n2. Select the stuck device\n3. Click **Sync** (top menu)\n\n> **Screenshot placeholder:** *Show the Sync button location in Endpoint Manager*\n\nIf this doesn't work, move to Method 2.\n\n## Method 2: Client-Side Sync (User-Initiated)\n\nOn the affected Windows device:\n\n1. Click **Start** → type **\"Company Portal\"**\n2. Open Company Portal app\n3. Click on **Devices**\n4. Select the device\n5. Click **Check Settings**\n\nThis triggers a check-in using the logged-in user's context.\n\n```powershell\n# Alternative: Trigger via PowerShell (as admin)\n# On the client machine\nStart-Process \"companyportal://syncdevice\"\n```\n\n## Method 3: Restart Intune Services\n\nSometimes the local services get stuck. Restart them:\n\n```powershell\n# Run as Administrator on the client\nRestart-Service -Name \"Intune Management Extension\" -Force\nStart-Sleep -Seconds 5\nStart-Service -Name \"Intune Management Extension\"\n\n# Also restart the MDMWaitron service\nRestart-Service -Name \"MDMWaitron\" -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue\n```\n\nThen try syncing again.\n\n## Method 4: Clear Cache and Re-register\n\nThis is the most effective fix for persistent sync issues:\n\n### Step 1: Remove Device from Intune\n\n```powershell\n# On client - get device ID\n$DeviceID = (Get-ItemProperty -Path \"HKLM:\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Provisioning\\Diagnostics\\IntuneProvisioning\" -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue).AgentVersion\nif (-not $DeviceID) {\n    $DeviceID = (Get-ItemProperty -Path \"HKLM:\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\MDM\\AutoEnrollMDM\" -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue).DeviceID\n}\nWrite-Host \"Device ID: $DeviceID\"\n```\n\n### Step 2: Clean Local Cache\n\n```powershell\n# Stop services\nGet-Service -Name \"Intune*\" | Stop-Service -Force\n\n# Remove cached data\nRemove-Item -Path \"$env:ProgramData\\Microsoft\\Intune\\*\" -Recurse -Force -Confirm:$false\n\n# Restart services  \nGet-Service -Name \"Intune*\" | Start-Service\n```\n\n### Step 3: Re-provision\n\n```powershell\n# Trigger re-provisioning\n\"C:\\Program Files\\Microsoft\\OnlineManagement\\ProvTool\\ProvTool.exe\" /Oobe /Q\n```\n\n## Method 5: Check for Certificate Issues\n\nExpired certificates are a common cause. Check on the client:\n\n```powershell\n# Check Intune certificate validity\nGet-ChildItem -Path \"Cert:\\LocalMachine\\My\" | Where-Object { $_.Subject -like \"*Intune*\" } | \n    Select-Object Subject, NotAfter, Thumbprint\n```\n\nIf expired:\n1. Go to **Settings** → **Access work or school**\n2. Disconnect the work/school account\n3. Re-enroll via **Settings** → **Accounts** → **Access work or school** → **Connect**\n\n## Method 6: Check for Policy Conflicts\n\nMultiple policies targeting the same setting can cause sync loops:\n\n1. In Intune, go to **Devices** → **Configuration profiles**\n2. Filter by the device platform\n3. Look for duplicate or conflicting profiles\n4. Check the device's **Device conflicts** view\n\n```powershell\n# Graph API: Get device conflict info\nGet-MgDeviceManagementManagedDevice -Filter \"deviceName eq 'TARGETDEVICE'\" | \n    Select-Object -ExpandProperty ConfigurationStates\n```\n\n## Prevention Tips\n\n1. **Don't deploy too many policies at once** — stagger deployments\n2. **Use groups wisely** — avoid rapid group changes\n3. **Monitor the Enrollment status** — catch issues early\n4. **Keep certificates updated** — check expiration quarterly\n\n## Wrap-Up\n\nStuck sync is frustrating but usually fixable. Start with a simple console sync, move to client-side restart, and go full cache clear if needed. \n\nNeed help?

Fix Group Policy and registry settings that lock location.",[108,277,278,279,164],"location-services","group-policy","registry","# Fix Grayed Out Location Services in Windows\n\nYou need to enable Location Services for an app, but the toggle is grayed out. You click it, nothing happens. You check Settings, nothing. This is a common issue in corporate environments — and it usually means a Group Policy or registry key is blocking it.\n\n## The Problem\n\nThe **Location Services** toggle in Windows Settings is:\n- Grayed out / Disabled\n- Or gives an error when you try to turn it on\n- Or only allows turning off, not on\n\n## Quick Fix: Registry Edit\n\nThe fastest fix is often a registry tweak.\n\n### Step 1: Open Registry Editor\n\n1. Press **Win + R**\n2. Type `regedit` → press **Enter**\n3. Navigate to:\n\n```\nHKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SOFTWARE\\Policies\\Microsoft\\Windows\\LocationAndSensors\n```\n\n### Step 2: Check the Values\n\nLook for these DWORD values:\n- **DisableLocation** = 1 → Set to **0**\n- **DisableLocationScripting** = 1 → Set to **0**\n\n```powershell\n# Quick PowerShell fix\nSet-ItemProperty -Path \"HKLM:\\SOFTWARE\\Policies\\Microsoft\\Windows\\LocationAndSensors\" -Name \"DisableLocation\" -Value 0 -Type DWord\nSet-ItemProperty -Path \"HKLM:\\SOFTWARE\\Policies\\Microsoft\\Windows\\LocationAndSensors\" -Name \"DisableLocationScripting\" -Value 0 -Type DWord\n```\n\n> **Screenshot placeholder:** *Show registry values*\n\n### Step 3: Restart or Sign Out\n\nChanges may require a restart or sign-out to take effect.\n\n## Fix #2: Group Policy\n\nIf the registry key keeps reverting, a Group Policy is likely enforcing it.\n\n### Check Local Group Policy\n\n1. Press **Win + R** → type `gpedit.msc`\n2. Navigate to:\n\n```\nComputer Configuration → Administrative Templates → System → Location and Sensors\n```\n\n3. Look for **\"Turn off location\"** — if it's **Enabled**, that's your culprit.\n\n### The Fix\n\nSet it to **Not Configured** or **Disabled**, then restart.\n\n```powershell\n# Check via PowerShell\nGet-ItemProperty -Path \"HKLM:\\SOFTWARE\\Policies\\Microsoft\\Windows\\LocationAndSensors\" -Name \"DisableLocation\" -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue\n```\n\n## Fix #3: MDM/Intune Policy\n\nIf you're on a managed device, Intune might be pushing a device restriction.\n\n### Check Intune\n\n1. Go to **Microsoft Endpoint Manager**\n2. **Devices** → **Configuration profiles**\n3. Look for profiles with **\"Location Services\"** settings\n\n### The Fix\n\nEither:\n- Update the policy to allow location\n- Create an exclusion group for affected devices\n\n```powershell\n# Check MDM diagnostic logs\n$LogPath = \"$env:ProgramData\\Microsoft\\Intune\\Logs\\MDMMgmt.log\"\nGet-Content $LogPath -Tail 50 | Select-String -Pattern \"Location\"\n```\n\n## Fix #4: User Account Issues\n\nSometimes the issue is user-specific.\n\n### Step 1: Create a New Local Admin Test\n\n1. Create a new local admin account\n2. Log in as that user\n3. Check if Location Services is enabled\n\nIf it works, the issue is with your user profile.\n\n### Step 2: Reset Location Settings\n\n```powershell\n# Reset location for current user\nGet-ItemProperty -Path \"HKCU:\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\LocationAndSensors\" | Remove-Item -Recurse -Force\n```\n\n## Fix #5: System Services\n\nCheck the Location service is running:\n\n1. Press **Win + R** → type `services.msc`\n2. Find **\"Windows Location Service\"**\n3. Ensure it's **Running** and set to **Automatic**\n\n```powershell\n# Check and start service\nGet-Service -Name \"Windows Location Service\" | Set-Service -StartupType Automatic\nStart-Service -Name \"Windows Location Service\"\n```\n\n## Fix #6: Registry Permissions\n\nIf you can't edit the registry, you may need to take ownership:\n\n1. Right-click the key → **Permissions**\n2. Take ownership as Administrator\n3. Grant Full Control to user\n\n## Quick Summary your\n\n| Fix | Method |\n|-----|--------|\n| 1 | Registry edit → DisableLocation = 0 |\n| 2 | Group Policy → gpedit.msc |\n| 3 | Check Intune MDM policies |\n| 4 | Test with new user account |\n| 5 | Verify Windows Location Service running |\n| 6 | Fix registry permissions |\n\n## Wrap-Up\n\nGrayed out Location Services is almost always a policy block. Check registry first, then Group Policy, then MDM. \n\nQuestions?

But there's a lot of noise in there. This guide covers the essential logs you need to monitor and how to read them effectively.\n\n## The Big Five Logs\n\n### 1. System Log\n**Location:** `Application and Services Logs\\Microsoft\\Windows\\EventID\\...`\n\nWhat you'll find:\n- Driver failures\n- Service starts/stops\n- Hardware issues\n- Blue Screen events (BugCheck)\n\n```powershell\n# Quick System log check\nGet-WinEvent -LogName System -MaxEvents 50 | \n    Where-Object { $_.LevelDisplayName -eq 'Error' } | \n    Select-Object TimeCreated, Id, Message\n```\n\n### 2. Application Log\n\nWhat you'll find:\n- Application crashes\n- .NET errors\n- Software installation issues\n\n```powershell\n# Recent application errors\nGet-WinEvent -LogName Application -MaxEvents 20 |\n    Where-Object { $_.Level -eq 2 } |\n    Select-Object TimeCreated, ProviderName, Message\n```\n\n### 3. Security Log\n\nWhat you'll find:\n- Logon events (4624, 4625)\n- Account changes (4728, 4729)\n- Privilege use (4672)\n- Failed password attempts\n\n```powershell\n# Recent successful logons\nGet-WinEvent -LogName Security -FilterHashtable @{\n    ID = 4624\n    TimeCreated = (Get-Date).AddHours(-24)\n} -MaxEvents 10 | Select-Object TimeCreated, @{N='User';E={$_.Properties[5].Value}}\n\n# Failed logon attempts\nGet-WinEvent -LogName Security -FilterHashtable @{\n    ID = 4625\n    TimeCreated = (Get-Date).AddHours(-24)\n} -MaxEvents 10\n```\n\n### 4. Setup Log\n\nWhat you'll find:\n- Windows Update issues\n- Installation failures\n- Component store corruption\n\n```powershell\n# Setup log location\n$SetupLog = \"$env:SystemRoot\\Panther\\setupact.log\"\nGet-Content $SetupLog -Tail 50\n```\n\n### 5. Microsoft-Windows-DeviceManagement-Enterprise-Diagnostics-Provider/Admin\n\nWhat you'll find:\n- Intune enrollment issues\n- MDM sync problems\n- Policy deployment failures\n\n```powershell\n# Intune/MDM logs\nGet-WinEvent -LogName \"Microsoft-Windows-DeviceManagement-Enterprise-Diagnostics-Provider/Admin\" -MaxEvents 20\n```\n\n## Essential Event IDs to Know\n\n### Security\n| Event ID | Meaning |\n|----------|---------|\n| 4624 | Successful logon |\n| 4625 | Failed logon |\n| 4634 | Logoff |\n| 4672 | Special privileges assigned |\n| 4720 | User account created |\n| 4726 | User account deleted |\n\n### System\n| Event ID | Meaning |\n|----------|---------|\n| 6005 | Event Log service started |\n| 6006 | Event Log service stopped |\n| 6008 | Unexpected shutdown |\n| 7036 | Service state changed |\n| 7045 | New service installed |\n\n## PowerShell Log Queries\n\n### The \"Something Broke\" Starter Pack\n\n```powershell\n# Everything error-level from last 24 hours\nGet-WinEvent -FilterHashtable @{\n    LogName = 'System', 'Application'\n    Level = 2\n    StartTime = (Get-Date).AddDays(-1)\n} -MaxEvents 100\n\n# Find crashes\nGet-WinEvent -FilterHashtable @{LogName='Application'; StartTime=(Get-Date).AddDays(-7)} |\n    Where-Object { $_.Message -match \"faulting|exception|error\" } |\n    Select-Object TimeCreated, ProviderName, Message\n```\n\n### Monitor a Specific Service\n\n```powershell\n# Track a service\n$ServiceName = \"W32Time\"\nGet-WinEvent -FilterHashtable @{\n    LogName = 'System'\n    ProviderName = 'Microsoft-Windows-Time-Service'\n} -MaxEvents 50\n```\n\n## Remote Log Collection\n\n```powershell\n# Collect from remote computer\nInvoke-Command -ComputerName \"TARGET-PC\" -ScriptBlock {\n    Get-WinEvent -LogName System -MaxEvents 20 -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue\n} | Select-Object TimeCreated, MachineName, Message\n```\n\n## Pro Tips\n\n1. **Create custom views** — Filter once, save the view\n2. **Use XML queries** — More powerful filtering\n3. **Export to CSV** — For analysis\n4. **Set up subscriptions** — Central collection with Windows Event Forwarding\n\n## Wrap-Up\n\nThe Event Logs are your friend. Know your Event IDs, build good queries, and you'll diagnose issues faster.\n\nQuestions?

This is a classic imaging problem — and it has some classic fixes.\n\n## The Symptoms\n\n- Windows boots to \"Let's connect you to a network\" screen repeatedly\n- Stuck on \"Just a moment...\" for hours\n- Profile doesn't create — you get a temp profile\n- \"The user profile service failed the logon\"\n- OOBE crashes or hangs\n\n## Fix #1: Clear Previous Provisioning Data\n\nThe most common cause — Windows thinks it's already been set up.\n\n```powershell\n# From WinPE or recovery\n# Mount the image and run:\ndism /Image:C:\\ /Cleanup-Image /ScanHealth\ndism /Image:C:\\ /Cleanup-Image /RestoreHealth\n\n# Or on the local machine (run as admin)\nGet-AppxProvisionedPackage -Online | Remove-AppxProvisionedPackage -AllUsers\n```\n\n## Fix #2: Delete SID and Provisioning Files\n\n```powershell\n# Navigate to:\nC:\\Users\\Default\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Windows\n\n# Delete these folders if they exist:\n# - ShellExperienceHost\n# - TileStore\n# - WebView2\n\n# Also delete:\nC:\\Windows\\System32\\Sysprep\\Panther\\*\n```\n\n## Fix #3: Reset OOBE\n\n```powershell\n# From WinPE or recovery environment\n# Run:\nsystemreset -cleanboot\n\n# Or:\nmdmdiagnostics.exe -o C:\\Logs\n```\n\n## Fix #4: Network Profile Reset\n\nSometimes stuck on network screen due to cached profiles:\n\n```powershell\n# Boot to WinPE, mount the image:\ndism /mount-image /imagefile:C:\\mount\\winpe.wim /index:1 /mountdir:C:\\mount\n\n# Delete network profiles:\ndel C:\\mount\\Windows\\System32\\config\\systemprofile\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Windows\\NlaCache\\*\n\n# Unmount and commit:\ndism /unmount-image /mountdir:C:\\mount /commit\n```\n\n## Fix #5: Fix User Profile Corruption\n\nIf the profile fails to create:\n\n```powershell\n# Delete corrupted profile data\nRemove-Item -Path \"C:\\Users\\Default\" -Recurse -Force -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue\n\n# Rebuild default profile\n# Copy from:\n$env:SystemRoot\\System32\\Config\\SystemProfile\n# To:\n$env:SystemRoot\\Users\\Default\n\n# Fix permissions\nicacls C:\\Users\\Default /reset /T\n```\n\n## Fix #6: Check Unattend.xml\n\nIf you're using an answer file, it might be malformed:\n\n```powershell\n# Validate unattend.xml\n# Location: C:\\Windows\\Panther\\unattend.xml\n\n# Check for:\n# - EnableNetworkProvisioning = true\n# - HideEULAPage = true\n# - HideWirelessSetupInOOBE = true\n# - NetworkLocation = Work\n# - ProtectYourPC = 1\n```\n\n## Fix #7: General Sysprep Best Practice\n\nHere's the proper sysprep sequence:\n\n```powershell\n# 1. Run Sysprep with generalize and shutdown\nsysprep /generalize /oobe /shutdown /quiet\n\n# 2. Capture with DISM\ndism /capture-image /imagefile:C:\\captures\\myimage.wim /capture:C:\\ /name:\"Windows 11\" /compress:fast\n\n# 3. Deploy\ndism /apply-image /imagefile:C:\\captures\\myimage.wim /index:1 /applydir:C:\\\nbcdboot C:\\Windows /s C:\n```\n\n## Fix #8: VM-Specific Issues\n\nIf imaging a VM (Hyper-V, VMware):\n\n```powershell\n# Disable Network Adapter teaming/hypervisor features\n# In the VM, run:\nbcdedit /set hypervisorlaunchtype off\n\n# Or add to answer file:\n\u003CNetworkAdapter>\n    \u003CMetaData>\n        \u003CKey>Sysprep.HyperV.Deploy\u003C/Key>\n        \u003CValue>False\u003C/Value>\n    \u003C/MetaData>\n\u003C/NetworkAdapter>\n```\n\n## Quick Checklist\n\n- [ ] Clear provisioning data\n- [ ] Delete Panther folder\n- [ ] Validate unattend.xml\n- [ ] Check network drivers\n- [ ] Verify disk space\n- [ ] Reset OOBE\n\n## Wrap-Up\n\nFirst-sign-in issues are almost always related to Sysprep not running correctly or cached data from the source machine. Follow the fixes above systematically.\n\nNeed help?

Windows Update for Business Deployment in Intune gives you control over when and how updates are installed.\n\n## Understanding Update Types\n\n### Quality Updates\n- Security patches\n- Bug fixes\n- Released monthly (Patch Tuesday)\n- Mandatory\n\n### Feature Updates\n- New Windows versions (22H2 → 23H2)\n- Released bi-annually\n- Optional but recommended\n\n## Creating Deployment Rings\n\n### Ring 1: Pilot (IT)\n```powershell\n# Create via Intune or Graph\n$RingParams = @{\n    DisplayName = \"Pilot - IT\"\n    RingType = \"featureUpdate\"\n    TargetVersion = \"Windows 11 24H2\"\n    DeferralDays = 0\n    OfferDays = 0\n}\n```\n\n### Ring 2: Fast\n- Defer 7 days\n- IT and power users\n\n### Ring 3: Broad\n- Defer 14-30 days\n- General users\n\n### Ring 4: Critical\n- Defer 60+ days\n- Security only\n\n## Configuring Update Policies\n\n### Quality Update Policy\n```powershell\n# Via Intune:\n# Devices → Windows → Update rings → Create\n\n# Key settings:\n# - Automatic update behavior: Auto-install and restart\n# - Active hours start/end: Configure user work hours\n# - Days until deferral: 0-4 weeks\n# - Require user input: Yes/No\n```\n\n### Feature Update Policy\n```powershell\n# Devices → Windows → Feature updates → Create\n\n# Settings:\n# - Target version: Windows 11 24H2\n# - Deferral days: 0-365\n# - Offer days: 0-28 after release\n```\n\n## Business Hours Configuration\n\n```powershell\n# Configure active hours\n# This prevents restarts during work hours\n# \n# Recommended:\n# - Start: 8:00 AM\n# - End: 6:00 PM\n# - User control: Allow\n```\n\n## Driver Updates\n\n```powershell\n# Enable driver updates\n# Devices → Configuration profiles → Delivery Optimization\n# \n# Settings:\n# - Download mode: LAN (1)\n# - Enable peer caching: Yes\n# - Maximum cache size: 10-50%\n```\n\n## Managing Restarts\n\n```powershell\n# Configure restart behavior\n# \n# Options:\n# - Auto restart after update: Yes\n# - Restart check frequency: Hourly\n# - Bypass active hours: No\n# - User can pause: Yes/No\n```\n\n## Delivery Optimization\n\nReduces bandwidth by using peer caching:\n\n```powershell\n# Enable via Group Policy or Intune\n# \n# Download modes:\n# 0 = BITS\n# 1 = HTTP only, no peering\n# 2 = HTTP blended with LAN\n# 3 = HTTP blended with WAN\n# 99 = Simple download mode\n# 100 = BITS only\n```\n\n## Monitoring Updates\n\n```powershell\n# Check update status via Graph\nGet-MgDeviceManagementWindowsQualityUpdate -All | \n    Select-Object DisplayName, ComponentName, KBNumber, DeploymentDate\n\n# Check device compliance\nGet-MgDeviceManagementManagedDevice -All | \n    Where-Object { $_.osVersion -like \"*22H2*\" }\n```\n\n## Common Issues\n\n### Updates Not Installing\n- Check network connectivity\n- Verify disk space (minimum 10GB)\n- Check for conflicting policies\n\n### Restart Loop\n- Configure active hours\n- Enable \"Notify user\"\n\n### Drivers Reverting\n- Exclude drivers from updates\n- Use specific driver versions\n\n## Best Practices\n\n1. **Start with pilot ring** — Test before broad deployment\n2. **Monitor closely** — Check for issues in first week\n3. **Communicate with users** — Tell them when updates happen\n4. **Keep rings staggered** — Don't deploy to everyone at once\n\n## Wrap-Up\n\nWindows Update for Business gives enterprise control. Use deployment rings, configure active hours, and monitor closely.\n\nQuestions?
