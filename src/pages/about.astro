        Welcome to zakitpro — your go-to resource for IT desktop engineering knowledge.
      </p>
      
      <h2>Who I Am</h2>
      <p>
        I'm a senior endpoint engineer with over 20 years of experience in IT desktop support, 
        deployment, and enterprise management. I've seen the industry evolve from Windows XP 
        to Windows 11, from manual installations to Intune, from legacy apps to cloud services.
      </p>
      
      <h2>What I Write About</h2>
      <p>
        This blog covers the real-world challenges that IT pros face every day:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Troubleshooting</strong> — Deep dives into Windows issues, error codes, and event log forensics</li>
        <li><strong>Scripting</strong> — PowerShell automation, Graph API, and task scheduling</li>
        <li><strong>Deployment</strong> — Autopilot, MDT, imaging, and provisioning</li>
        <li><strong>Security</strong> — Endpoint protection, BitLocker, CIS benchmarks</li>
        <li><strong>Packaging</strong> — Intune Win32 apps, PSADT, and silent installs</li>
        <li><strong>Career</strong> — Certifications, lab setups, and career progression</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h2>Why This Blog?</h2>
      <p>
        Most IT blogs are either too basic (click this, then click that) or too theoretical 
        (academic papers about distributed systems). This blog is for working engineers who need 
        practical solutions to real problems.
      </p>
      <p>
        Every article is written from experience — either something I've debugged in production 
        or built for my own environment. If it doesn't work in the real world, I don't write about it.
      </p>
      
      <h2>No Fluff, No Ads</h2>
      <p>
        This blog has no advertisements, no tracking, and no sponsored content. 
        It's funded by readers who find it useful. If something here helped you, 
        consider supporting the work.
