# Intune Compliance Policies Explained

Compliance policies in Intune define what makes a device "healthy" and secure. Combined with Conditional Access, they control device access to resources.

## What Are Compliance Policies?

Rules that devices must meet to:
- Access corporate resources
- Use conditional access
- Be considered "managed"

## Creating a Policy

1. **Microsoft Endpoint Manager** → **Devices** → **Compliance policies**
2. **Create policy** → **Windows 10 and later**
3. Set conditions and actions

## Key Settings

### Device Health

| Setting | Options | Recommended |
|---------|---------|-------------|
| BitLocker | Require | Yes |
| Secure Boot | Require | Yes |
| Code Integrity | Require | Yes |
| Device Health Attestation | Require | Yes |

### Device Properties

```powershell
# Via Graph
$Policy = @{
    "@odata.type" = "#microsoft.graph.windows10CompliancePolicy"
    deviceThreatProtectionRequiredSecurityLevel = " Secured"
    bitLockerEnabled = $true
    secureBootEnabled = $true
    codeIntegrityEnabled = $true
}
```

### System Security

| Setting | Value |
|---------|-------|
| Password type | Alphanumeric |
| Minimum password length | 14 |
| Password age (days) | 60 |
| Device password | Required |

### Microsoft Defender

```powershell
# Require Defender
defenderEnabled = $true
defenderVersion = "latest"
```

## Compliance Actions

When device is non-compliant:

| Action | What Happens |
|--------|--------------|
| Mark as non-compliant | Visual indicator |
| Send email to user | Notification |
| Wipe device | Full reset |
| Retire device | Remove from Intune |

## Conditional Access Integration

Compliance + Conditional Access = Access Control

```powershell
# Example: Require compliant device for Exchange
# 1. Create compliance policy (above)
# 2. Create conditional access policy in Azure AD:
#   - Grant: Require device to be marked as compliant
#   - Apps: Exchange Online
#   - Users: All users
```

## Monitoring Compliance

```powershell
# Check compliance status
Get-MgDeviceManagementDeviceCompliancePolicyState -DeviceId $DeviceId

# Get all compliant/non-compliant
Get-MgDeviceManagementDeviceCompliancePolicyState -All | 
    Where-Object { $_.ComplianceState -eq "noncompliant" }
```

## Wrap-Up

Compliance policies are your first line of defense. Define healthy, require it with Conditional Access, and monitor compliance.
