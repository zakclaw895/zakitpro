### Meaning
A driver tried to access memory it shouldn't.

### Fix
```powershell
# Boot to safe mode
# Uninstall recent driver updates
# Roll back to previous version

# Check for problematic drivers
driverquery /v | findstr /i "error"

# Update BIOS and chipset drivers
```

## PAGE_FAULT_IN_NONPAGED_AREA

### Meaning
System tried to access invalid memory.

### Fix
```powershell
# Check RAM
mdsched.exe

# Update drivers

# Update Windows
```

## KERNEL_DATA_INPAGE_ERROR (7A)

### Meaning
Couldn't read/write data to disk.

### Fix
```powershell
# Check disk health

# Check cable connections
# Test with different SATA port
```

## SYSTEM_THREAD_EXCEPTION_NOT_HANDLED

### Meaning
A driver didn't handle an exception properly.

### Fix
```powershell

### Meaning
Graphics driver timed out.

### Fix
```powershell
# Roll back graphics driver
# Update to latest driver
# Disable overclocking
# Check GPU temperature

# Disable TDR in registry (temporary):
Set-ItemProperty -Path "HKLM:\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\GraphicsDrivers" -Name "TdrLevel" -Value 0 -Type DWord
```

## IRQL_NOT_LESS_OR_EQUAL

### Meaning
Driver accessed memory at wrong IRQL.

### Fix
- Update all drivers
- Check for conflicting software
