# Intune Device Wipe and Retire

When a device needs to be reset or removed, Intune gives you options. Here's when to use each.

## Wipe vs Retire

| Action | What Happens | Use When |
|--------|--------------|----------|
| **Retire** | Remove managed apps/data, keep device | User leaves, device reassigned |
| **Wipe** | Factory reset, delete everything | Device being sold, serious issues |
| **Autopilot Reset** | Clean but keep enrollment | Refresh device, keep Intune |

## Retire a Device

```powershell
# Via Graph API
$DeviceId = (Get-MgDeviceManagementManagedDevice -Filter "deviceName eq 'LAPTOP-001'").Id

Invoke-MgDeviceManagementManagedDeviceRetireManagedDevice -ManagedDeviceId $DeviceId
```

### What Happens
- Company data removed
- Apps uninstalled
- Settings reverted
- Device remains in Intune (unmanaged)

## Wipe a Device

```powershell
# Full wipe
$DeviceId = (Get-MgDeviceManagementManagedDevice -Filter "deviceName eq 'LAPTOP-001'").Id

Invoke-MgDeviceManagementManagedDeviceWipeManagedDevice -ManagedDeviceId $DeviceId -KeepUserData $false
```

### Options
- **Keep user data**: Yes/No
- **Persist enrolled apps**: Yes/No (Windows)

## Autopilot Reset

```powershell
# Trigger Autopilot reset
$DeviceId = (Get-MgDeviceManagementManagedDevice -Filter "deviceName eq 'LAPTOP-001'").Id

Invoke-MgDeviceManagementManagedDevice windowsAutopilotDeviceIdentity -ManagedDeviceId $DeviceId -ResetAccount
```

### What It Does
- Removes user accounts
- Re-enrolls in Intune
- Like fresh OOBE
- Keeps Autopilot enrollment

## Confirmation Required

```powershell
# Devices in user-driven enrollment require:
# - User confirmation on device
# OR
# - Recovery key provided first

# Check if device requires recovery key
Get-MgDeviceManagementManagedDevice -DeviceId $DeviceId |
    Select-Object recoveryKeyIdentifier
```

## Pre-Wipe Checklist

- [ ] Backup user data (if keeping)
- [ ] Export BitLocker keys
- [ ] Document serial number
- [ ] Check device ownership

```powershell
# Export BitLocker keys before wipe
Get-MgDeviceManagementManagedDeviceBitLockerRecoveryKey -ManagedDeviceId $DeviceId
```

## Automation Script

```powershell
<#
.SYNOPSIS
    Safely wipe a device
#>
param(
    [Parameter(Mandatory=$true)]
    [string]$DeviceName,
    
    [Parameter(Mandatory=$false)]
    [switch]$KeepUserData
)

$Device = Get-MgDeviceManagementManagedDevice -Filter "deviceName eq '$DeviceName'"

if (-not $Device) {
    Write-Host "Device not found: $DeviceName"
    exit 1
}

# Export recovery keys first
$Keys = Get-MgDeviceManagementManagedDeviceBitLockerRecoveryKey -ManagedDeviceId $Device.Id

# Backup keys
$Keys | Export-Csv -Path ".\$DeviceName-BitLockerKeys.csv"

# Confirm wipe
Write-Host "About to WIPE device: $DeviceName"
Write-Host "This cannot be undone!"
$Confirm = Read-Host "Type 'YES' to confirm"

if ($Confirm -eq "YES") {
    Invoke-MgDeviceManagementManagedDeviceWipeManagedDevice -ManagedDeviceId $Device.Id -KeepUserData:$KeepUserData
    Write-Host "Wipe initiated"
}
```

## Wrap-Up

Use Retire for reassignment, Wipe for disposal, Autopilot Reset for refresh. Always backup keys first.
