# Windows Autopilot: The Complete Guide

Windows Autopilot is Microsoft's modern deployment solution. Here's everything you need to know.

## What is Autopilot?

A cloud-based deployment service that:
- Transforms new devices from "blank" to "ready to use"
- Requires no IT infrastructure
- Configures devices via Intune

## Deployment Modes

### User-Driven
- Traditional OOBE experience
- User logs in with corporate credentials
- Device joins Azure AD and enrolls in Intune

### Self-Deploying (Zero-Touch)
- No user interaction required
- Device provisions itself
- Great for kiosks, digital signage

### White Glove
- IT pre-provisions device
- User gets fresh out-of-box experience

## Getting Started

### Step 1: Register Devices

```powershell
# Get hardware hash
Get-WindowsAutoPilotInfo -Computer . | Export-CSV -Path ".\hardwarehash.csv"

# Or use CSV import in Intune
```

### Step 2: Create Profile

1. Go to **Intune** → **Devices** → **Windows** → **Autopilot deployment profiles**
2. **Create profile**
3. Configure settings:
   - Join type: Azure AD joined
   - Out-of-box experience: User-driven
   - Language: Match device
   - Account type: Standard user

### Step 3: Assign Profile

- Assign to device group
- Or auto-assign based on order ID

## Profile Settings

| Setting | Options |
|---------|---------|
| Deployment mode | User-driven / Self-deploying |
| Join to | Azure AD |
| Out-of-box experience | Full customization |
| Language | en-US, etc. |
| Keyboard | Primary + login |
| Device name template | CORP-%SERIAL% |

## Device Preparation

### For Self-Deploying Mode
- TPM 2.0 required
- Ethernet recommended
- Wired connection for initial setup

### For User-Driven
- Works over WiFi
- User needs credentials

## Troubleshooting

### Profile Not Applying

```powershell
# Check device enrollment
dsregcmd /status

# Check Autopilot state
Get-ItemProperty -Path "HKLM:\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Provisioning\Diagnostics\Autopilot"
```

### Device Not Showing

- Import hardware hash again
- Check assigned group
- Verify profile status

## Autopilot Reset

```powershell
# Local reset (preserve enrollment)
Reset-AzureAutopilotDevice -DeviceId "device-id"

# Full reset (wipe and re-enroll)
Wipe-AzureAutopilotDevice -DeviceId "device-id"
```

## Wrap-Up

Autopilot transforms device deployment. Start with user-driven mode, then explore self-deploying as you mature.
