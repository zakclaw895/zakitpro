# Fix Intune Enrollment Errors

Windows device enrollment in Intune should be seamless. When it fails, the error messages aren't always helpful. Here's how to fix the most common enrollment errors.

## Error: "0x80180014 - MDM Enrolled Failed"

This usually means the device already has an enrollment.

### Fix

```powershell
# Run on client
Get-ItemProperty -Path "HKLM:\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\MDM*" | Select-Object *

# Delete existing enrollment
Remove-Item -Path "HKLM:\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\MDM*" -Recurse -Force

# Re-enroll
"C:\Program Files\Microsoft OnlineManagement\ProvTool\ProvTool.exe" /Oobe /Q
```

## Error: "Device enrollment could not be completed"

Generic error — check these things:

### Fix

1. **Check Intune license**
```powershell
Get-MgUserLicenseDetail -UserId $env:USERNAME | Select-Object -ExpandProperty ServicePlans
```

2. **Check auto-enroll settings**
- Go to Microsoft Entra ID → Mobility (MDM and MAM)
- Enable "MDM user scope" for All or Some users

3. **Clear old enrollment**
```powershell
Remove-Item -Path "HKLM:\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Enrollments\*" -Recurse -Force
```

## Error: "0x801c0003 - The device is already enrolled"

The device has a stale enrollment record.

### Fix

```powershell
# In Intune, manually retire the device first
# Then on client:
dsregcmd /leave /debug

# Re-enroll
dsregcmd /join
```

## Error: "Certificate enrollment server not available"

Usually a network or DNS issue.

### Fix

```powershell
# Test connectivity
Test-NetConnection -ComputerName enterpriseregistration.windows.net -Port 443

# Check DNS
Resolve-DnsName enterpriseregistration.windows.net

# Check proxy
netsh winhttp show proxy
```

## Error: "Enrollment timed out"

### Fix

```powershell
# Increase timeout in registry
Set-ItemProperty -Path "HKLM:\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\MDM" -Name "EnrollmentTimeout" -Value 300 -Type DWord

# Check for third-party software blocking
Get-Process | Where-Object { $_.Company -notlike "Microsoft*" } | Select-Object Name, Company
```

## Error: Autopilot Profile Not Found

### Fix

1. **Assign profile to device group**
   - Intune → Devices → Windows → Autopilot deployment profiles
   - Assign to device group containing the hardware ID

2. **Upload hardware ID if missing**
   - Intune → Devices → Windows → Upload hardware IDs
   - Get hardware ID: `Get-WindowsAutoPilotInfo -Computer .`

## Error: 0x80180005 - Unknown Error

Usually permission-related.

### Fix

```powershell
# Check user has enrollment permission
# In Intune: Device enrollment managers → Add your account

# Or check MDM authority
Get-ItemProperty -Path "HKLM:\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\MDM" -Name "MdmAuthority"
```
