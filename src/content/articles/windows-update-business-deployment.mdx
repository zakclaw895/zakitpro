# Windows Update for Business Deployment

Managing Windows updates in enterprise requires a strategy. Windows Update for Business Deployment in Intune gives you control over when and how updates are installed.

## Understanding Update Types

### Quality Updates
- Security patches
- Bug fixes
- Released monthly (Patch Tuesday)
- Mandatory

### Feature Updates
- New Windows versions (22H2 → 23H2)
- Released bi-annually
- Optional but recommended

## Creating Deployment Rings

### Ring 1: Pilot (IT)
```powershell
# Create via Intune or Graph
$RingParams = @{
    DisplayName = "Pilot - IT"
    RingType = "featureUpdate"
    TargetVersion = "Windows 11 24H2"
    DeferralDays = 0
    OfferDays = 0
}
```

### Ring 2: Fast
- Defer 7 days
- IT and power users

### Ring 3: Broad
- Defer 14-30 days
- General users

### Ring 4: Critical
- Defer 60+ days
- Security only

## Configuring Update Policies

### Quality Update Policy
```powershell
# Via Intune:
# Devices → Windows → Update rings → Create

# Key settings:
# - Automatic update behavior: Auto-install and restart
# - Active hours start/end: Configure user work hours
# - Days until deferral: 0-4 weeks
# - Require user input: Yes/No
```

### Feature Update Policy
```powershell
# Devices → Windows → Feature updates → Create

# Settings:
# - Target version: Windows 11 24H2
# - Deferral days: 0-365
# - Offer days: 0-28 after release
```

## Business Hours Configuration

```powershell
# Configure active hours
# This prevents restarts during work hours
# 
# Recommended:
# - Start: 8:00 AM
# - End: 6:00 PM
# - User control: Allow
```

## Driver Updates

```powershell
# Enable driver updates
# Devices → Configuration profiles → Delivery Optimization
# 
# Settings:
# - Download mode: LAN (1)
# - Enable peer caching: Yes
# - Maximum cache size: 10-50%
```

## Managing Restarts

```powershell
# Configure restart behavior
# 
# Options:
# - Auto restart after update: Yes
# - Restart check frequency: Hourly
# - Bypass active hours: No
# - User can pause: Yes/No
```

## Delivery Optimization

Reduces bandwidth by using peer caching:

```powershell
# Enable via Group Policy or Intune
# 
# Download modes:
# 0 = BITS
# 1 = HTTP only, no peering
# 2 = HTTP blended with LAN
# 3 = HTTP blended with WAN
# 99 = Simple download mode
# 100 = BITS only
```

## Monitoring Updates

```powershell
# Check update status via Graph
Get-MgDeviceManagementWindowsQualityUpdate -All | 
    Select-Object DisplayName, ComponentName, KBNumber, DeploymentDate

# Check device compliance
Get-MgDeviceManagementManagedDevice -All | 
    Where-Object { $_.osVersion -like "*22H2*" }
```

## Common Issues

### Updates Not Installing
- Check network connectivity
- Verify disk space (minimum 10GB)
- Check for conflicting policies

### Restart Loop
- Configure active hours
- Enable "Notify user"

### Drivers Reverting
- Exclude drivers from updates
- Use specific driver versions

## Best Practices

1. **Start with pilot ring** — Test before broad deployment
2. **Monitor closely** — Check for issues in first week
3. **Communicate with users** — Tell them when updates happen
4. **Keep rings staggered** — Don't deploy to everyone at once

## Wrap-Up

Windows Update for Business gives enterprise control. Use deployment rings, configure active hours, and monitor closely.
