# Fix Intune Access Denied Errors

You're trying to deploy an app, create a policy, or sync a device in Microsoft Intune, and suddenly you hit **"Access Denied."** It's one of the most frustrating errors because it usually means something is broken in your permission chain — and the error message rarely tells you *what*.

In this guide, I'll walk you through the most common causes of Access Denied in Intune and how to fix them.

## The Problem

You log into the Microsoft Endpoint Manager admin center, try to create a configuration profile, assign a policy, or even just view device details, and you get:

> **Access Denied. You don't have permission to access this resource.**

Sometimes it affects everything, sometimes just specific actions. Let's dig in.

## Cause #1: Missing Role Assignments

The most common cause. Intune uses Role-Based Access Control (RBAC), and if your account isn't assigned the right role, you're locked out.

### How to Check

1. Go to **Microsoft Endpoint Manager** → **Admin centers** → **Microsoft Endpoint Manager admin center**
2. Navigate to **Tenant administration** → **Roles** → **All roles**
3. Find your role or check what roles you have assigned

### The Fix

1. Go to **Tenant administration** → **Users** → Select your user
2. Check **Intune role** assignments
3. Add a built-in role like **Intune Administrator** or **Policy and Profile Manager**

## Cause #2: Scope Tags Misconfiguration

Scope tags restrict what resources you can manage. Even with the right role, if you don't have the right scope tag, Access Denied.

### How to Check

1. Go to **Tenant administration** → **Roles** → **All roles**
2. Open your assigned role
3. Look at the **Scope (Tags)** section

### The Fix

- Either assign the scope tag that contains your target devices/profiles
- Or create a custom role without scope tag restrictions

```powershell
# Quick check: What scope tags do I have?
Get-MgDeviceManagementRoleAssignment -Filter "principalId eq '$((Get-MgUser -UserId $env:USERNAME).id)'" | 
    Select-Object RoleDefinitionName, ScopeTags
```

## Cause #3: Incorrect License Assignment

You need an Intune license to manage devices. Without it, you can't access the admin center properly.

### The Fix

1. Go to **Microsoft 365 admin center** → **Users** → **Active users**
2. Select your account
3. Verify **Intune (Plan 1)** or **Microsoft Intune Plan 2** is assigned

```powershell
# Check license via Graph
Get-MgUserLicenseDetail -UserId $env:USERNAME | 
    Where-Object { $_.ServicePlans | Where-Object { $_.ServicePlanName -like "*Intune*" }}
```

## Cause #4: Conditional Access Policies Blocking Access

Conditional Access policies can lock you out of the Endpoint Manager portal if they exclude the admin accounts incorrectly.

### The Fix

1. Go to **Microsoft Entra ID** → **Security** → **Conditional Access**
2. Look for policies targeting "Microsoft Intune" or "Endpoint Manager"
3. Check the **Exclude** list — make sure your admin account isn't excluded inappropriately

> **Warning:** Be careful not to lock yourself out completely!

## Cause #5: Graph API Permissions (For Automation)

If you're using PowerShell scripts or automation (like the examples in this blog), you need the right API permissions.

### The Fix

If using Azure AD App registrations:
- **DeviceManagementManagedDevices.Read.All**
- **DeviceManagementConfiguration.ReadWrite.All**
- **DeviceManagementServiceConfiguration.ReadWrite.All**

```powershell
# Test Graph access
Connect-MgGraph -Scopes "DeviceManagementManagedDevices.Read.All"
Get-MgDeviceManagementManagedDevice -Top 1
```

## Cause #6: Device-Specific Block Issues

Sometimes Access Denied appears when trying to:
- Wipe a device
- Retire a device  
- Push apps to a specific device

### The Fix

1. Check if the device is **blocked** in Intune
2. Verify the device record exists and isn't orphaned
3. Check if the user has been removed from Azure AD (orphaned device)

```powershell
# Find the device and check its status
Get-MgDeviceManagementManagedDevice -Filter "deviceName eq 'TARGETDEVICE'" |
    Select-Object DeviceName, UserId, EnrollmentState, DeviceRegistrationPolicy
```

## Quick Troubleshooting Checklist

1. ✅ Do you have an Intune license?
2. ✅ Are you assigned an Intune role?
3. ✅ Does that role have the right permissions?
4. ✅ Does the role include the right scope tags?
5. ✅ Any Conditional Access policies blocking portal access?
6. ✅ Is this a Graph API permission issue?

## Wrap-Up

Access Denied in Intune is almost always a permission problem. Start with role assignments, check scope tags, verify licenses, and work your way through the list above.
