# Windows Event Log Essentials for IT

When something breaks, the Event Logs are your first stop. But there's a lot of noise in there. This guide covers the essential logs you need to monitor and how to read them effectively.

## The Big Five Logs

### 1. System Log
**Location:** `Application and Services Logs\Microsoft\Windows\EventID\...`

What you'll find:
- Driver failures
- Service starts/stops
- Hardware issues
- Blue Screen events (BugCheck)

```powershell
# Quick System log check
Get-WinEvent -LogName System -MaxEvents 50 | 
    Where-Object { $_.LevelDisplayName -eq 'Error' } | 
    Select-Object TimeCreated, Id, Message
```

### 2. Application Log

What you'll find:
- Application crashes
- .NET errors
- Software installation issues

```powershell
# Recent application errors
Get-WinEvent -LogName Application -MaxEvents 20 |
    Where-Object { $_.Level -eq 2 } |
    Select-Object TimeCreated, ProviderName, Message
```

### 3. Security Log

What you'll find:
- Logon events (4624, 4625)
- Account changes (4728, 4729)
- Privilege use (4672)
- Failed password attempts

```powershell
# Recent successful logons
Get-WinEvent -LogName Security -FilterHashtable @{
    ID = 4624
    TimeCreated = (Get-Date).AddHours(-24)
} -MaxEvents 10 | Select-Object TimeCreated, @{N='User';E={$_.Properties[5].Value}}

# Failed logon attempts
Get-WinEvent -LogName Security -FilterHashtable @{
    ID = 4625
    TimeCreated = (Get-Date).AddHours(-24)
} -MaxEvents 10
```

### 4. Setup Log

What you'll find:
- Windows Update issues
- Installation failures
- Component store corruption

```powershell
# Setup log location
$SetupLog = "$env:SystemRoot\Panther\setupact.log"
Get-Content $SetupLog -Tail 50
```

### 5. Microsoft-Windows-DeviceManagement-Enterprise-Diagnostics-Provider/Admin

What you'll find:
- Intune enrollment issues
- MDM sync problems
- Policy deployment failures

```powershell
# Intune/MDM logs
Get-WinEvent -LogName "Microsoft-Windows-DeviceManagement-Enterprise-Diagnostics-Provider/Admin" -MaxEvents 20
```

## Essential Event IDs to Know

### Security
| Event ID | Meaning |
|----------|---------|
| 4624 | Successful logon |
| 4625 | Failed logon |
| 4634 | Logoff |
| 4672 | Special privileges assigned |
| 4720 | User account created |
| 4726 | User account deleted |

### System
| Event ID | Meaning |
|----------|---------|
| 6005 | Event Log service started |
| 6006 | Event Log service stopped |
| 6008 | Unexpected shutdown |
| 7036 | Service state changed |
| 7045 | New service installed |

## PowerShell Log Queries

### The "Something Broke" Starter Pack

```powershell
# Everything error-level from last 24 hours
Get-WinEvent -FilterHashtable @{
    LogName = 'System', 'Application'
    Level = 2
    StartTime = (Get-Date).AddDays(-1)
} -MaxEvents 100

# Find crashes
Get-WinEvent -FilterHashtable @{LogName='Application'; StartTime=(Get-Date).AddDays(-7)} |
    Where-Object { $_.Message -match "faulting|exception|error" } |
    Select-Object TimeCreated, ProviderName, Message
```

### Monitor a Specific Service

```powershell
# Track a service
$ServiceName = "W32Time"
Get-WinEvent -FilterHashtable @{
    LogName = 'System'
    ProviderName = 'Microsoft-Windows-Time-Service'
} -MaxEvents 50
```

## Remote Log Collection

```powershell
# Collect from remote computer
Invoke-Command -ComputerName "TARGET-PC" -ScriptBlock {
    Get-WinEvent -LogName System -MaxEvents 20 -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue
} | Select-Object TimeCreated, MachineName, Message
```

## Pro Tips

1. **Create custom views** — Filter once, save the view
2. **Use XML queries** — More powerful filtering
3. **Export to CSV** — For analysis
4. **Set up subscriptions** — Central collection with Windows Event Forwarding

## Wrap-Up

The Event Logs are your friend. Know your Event IDs, build good queries, and you'll diagnose issues faster.
