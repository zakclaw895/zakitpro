Congratulations! You've set up your prerequisites, registered devices, and created deployment profiles. Now it's time for the moment of truth — actually testing your Autopilot deployment.

In this final part, we'll walk through what to expect, verify everything works, and troubleshoot any issues.

## What Happens When a User First Turns On the Device

When a user unpacks a new Autopilot-configured PC and turns it on, here's the journey they go through:

1. **Welcome Screen** — Language and keyboard selection
2. **Network Connection** — Connect to WiFi or Ethernet
3. **Sign In** — Enter their Azure AD credentials
4. **Enrollment** — Intune configures the device (this happens automatically!)
5. **Desktop** — User lands on a ready-to-use machine

> **Screenshot:** *User sign-in page*

> **Screenshot:** *Enrollment in progress*

> **Screenshot:** *Desktop ready*

> 💡 **Tip:** This entire process typically takes 10-20 minutes depending on network speed and how many policies you deploy.

## Step-by-Step: Test Your First Device

### 1. Reset the Device (If Previously Used)

If you're testing with a device that's been used before, you'll want to reset it first:

```powershell
# On the test device, run as Administrator:
Windows + I → Recovery → Reset PC → Remove everything → Local reinstall
```

Or use the **Intune Wipe** command from Endpoint Manager if the device is already enrolled.

### 2. Go Through OOBE

Power on the device and walk through the out-of-box experience:

1. Select your language and keyboard layout
2. Connect to the internet (WiFi or Ethernet)
3. When prompted, enter the Azure AD credentials of a test user
4. Wait while enrollment completes
5. You're on the desktop!

### 3. Verify Device Appears in Intune

Now let's confirm everything worked on the management side.

1. Open the **[Microsoft Endpoint Manager admin center](https://endpoint.microsoft.com)**
2. Go to **Devices → All devices**
3. Look for your test device

Click on the device to see its details:

Check these things:
- ✅ **Enrollment status:** Should show "Enrolled"
- ✅ **Last sync time:** Should be recent
- ✅ **Compliance status:** Should be "Compliant" (or "Not evaluated" briefly after enrollment)
- ✅ **Join type:** Should show "Azure AD joined"

> 💡 **Tip:** If the device doesn't appear immediately, click **Sync** to force a refresh.

## Deploy Your First Policy

Now that your device is enrolled, let's verify you can actually manage it by deploying a simple policy.

### Example: Rename the Computer Automatically

Let's create a configuration profile that renames the enrolled computer.

1. In Endpoint Manager, go to **Devices → Configuration profiles**
2. Click **Create profile**
3. Select **Windows 10 and later**
4. Choose **Settings catalog** (or use a template)

> **Screenshot:** *Create configuration profile*

For this example, let's use the **Device rename** template:

1. Search for "device rename" in settings
2. Configure the rename rule:
   - **Name pattern:** `{first}-{serial}` (e.g., "zak-DELL1234")
   - **Action:** Update

3. Assign to your test device or group

> **Screenshot:** *Configure device rename policy*

4. Click **Create**

### Trigger a Sync

After creating the policy, you need to push it to the device:

1. Go to **Devices → All devices**
2. Select your test device
3. Click **Sync**

> 💡 **Tip:** Wait 5-10 minutes for the policy to apply. The device checks in periodically.

### Verify the Rename

On your test device:
1. Open **Settings → System → About**
2. Check if the device name has changed to your new pattern!

## Common Issues & How to Fix Them

Don't panic if things don't work perfectly the first time. Here are the most common Autopilot issues and their solutions.

### Issue: "Profile Not Found" Error

**What you see:** During OOBE, the device says it can't find an Autopilot profile.

**Cause:** The profile hasn't been assigned to the device or group.

**Fix:**
1. Go to **Devices → Windows → Autopilot deployment profiles**
2. Open your profile
3. Click **Assign**
4. Make sure the device or its group is selected

### Issue: Enrollment Failed

**What you see:** "Enrollment failed" or similar error during setup.

**Cause:** Usually a license issue — the user doesn't have an Intune license.

**Fix:**
1. Check the user's license in **Microsoft 365 Admin Center**
2. Ensure they have Intune or M365 Business Premium
3. Assign the license if missing

### Issue: Can't Join Azure AD

**What you see:** Device can't connect to Azure AD during enrollment.

**Cause:** Network issues or Azure AD settings.

**Fix:**
1. Verify the device has internet access
2. Check **Devices → Azure AD devices → Device settings** in Endpoint Manager
3. Ensure "Users may join devices to Azure AD" is enabled
4. Check that the user isn't hitting device limits

### Issue: Device Not Appearing After Import

**What you see:** You imported the CSV but the device doesn't show up anywhere.

**Cause:** The hardware hash might be incorrect or the import failed silently.

**Fix:**
1. Go to **Devices → Windows → Windows devices**
2. Check for import errors
3. Re-run the PowerShell script and re-import
4. Make sure the CSV format is correct (no extra headers or columns)

### Issue: Policy Not Applying

**What you see:** You created a policy but it hasn't reached the device.

**Cause:** Timing or assignment issues.

**Fix:**
1. Check **Device status** in the policy details
2. Verify the device is in the assigned group
3. Click **Sync** on the device
4. Wait — it can take up to 24 hours but usually faster

> 💡 **Tip:** Most issues resolve by having the device **sync** or by **restarting** the device.

## Next Steps: Where Do You Go From Here?

You've completed the Autopilot basics! Here's where to explore next:

### 1. Add More Devices
- Register your organization's real devices
- Consider buying from OEMs who pre-register (less work!)

### 2. Explore Self-Deploying Mode
- For kiosk, digital signage, or shared devices
- No user login required — device automatically enrolls

### 3. Set Up Device Groups
- Create dynamic groups based on device attributes
- Target policies more precisely

### 4. Configure Compliance Policies
- Set requirements for what makes a device "healthy"
- Block access if devices aren't compliant

### 5. Application Deployment
- Push apps automatically during enrollment
- Configure required apps that install silently
