# Fix User Profile Corruption in Windows

User profile corruption causes login issues, missing settings, and temp profile loads. Here's how to diagnose and fix it.

## Symptoms

- User gets "The user profile service failed the logon"
- Profile loads as "Temp" profile
- Desktop icons, settings, documents missing
- "User profile cannot be loaded"

## Quick Fix: Delete Corrupted Profile

```powershell
# Run as Admin
# 1. Check current profiles
Get-CimInstance Win32_UserProfile | Select-Object LocalPath, LastUseTime, Status

# 2. Find the corrupted profile SID
# Look in:
C:\Users\

# 3. Delete the folder
# Navigate to:
HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\ProfileList

# 4. Delete the SID key for corrupted profile

# 5. Delete the folder in C:\Users\
```

## Fix #2: System File Checker

```powershell
# Run in Admin PowerShell
sfc /scannow

# If that fails
DISM /Online /Cleanup-Image /ScanHealth
DISM /Online /Cleanup-Image /RestoreHealth
```

## Fix #3: Rebuild Default Profile

```powershell
# 1. Boot to WinPE or another admin account
# 2. Delete the user folder
Remove-Item -Path "C:\Users\Username" -Recurse -Force

# 3. Create new profile from default
# Copy default profile:
$Default = "$env:SystemDrive\Users\Default"
$NewProfile = "C:\Users\NewUsername"
Copy-Item -Path $Default -Destination $NewProfile -Recurse

# 4. Fix permissions
icacls $NewProfile /reset /T
icacls $NewProfile /grant "DOMAIN\NewUsername:(OI)(CI)F"
```

## Fix #4: Registry Permissions

```powershell
# Profile list registry key permissions
# 1. Go to:
HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\ProfileList

# 2. Right-click → Permissions
# 3. Take ownership
# 4. Grant SYSTEM Full Control
# 5. Grant Administrators Full Control
```

## Fix #5: Disk Check

```powershell
# Check for disk errors
chkdsk C: /f /r

# Schedule for next reboot
# Say Y to schedule
```

## Prevention

1. **Don't delete profiles while user logged in**
2. **Use proper shutdown, not强制关机**
3. **Keep disk healthy**
4. **Monitor disk space**

## Wrap-Up

Corrupted profiles are common but fixable. Delete, rebuild, or fix permissions — choose based on severity.
