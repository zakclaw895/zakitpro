# BitLocker Recovery Keys: The Complete Guide

BitLocker is essential for endpoint security, but if you lose the recovery keys, you're in trouble. This guide covers everything about managing BitLocker recovery keys in enterprise environments.

## The Problem

You encrypt a machine with BitLocker, the user forgets their PIN, the TPM resets, or the machine reboots after a BIOS update — and suddenly you need the recovery key.

**If you don't have it backed up, you're locked out. Permanently.**

## Where Recovery Keys Are Stored

### 1. Active Directory (Best Option)

```powershell
# Enable BitLocker key backup to AD
# Via Group Policy:
# Computer Configuration → Administrative Templates → Windows Components → BitLocker Drive Encryption → Store BitLocker recovery information in Active Directory Domain Services

# Enable for domain members
Set-ItemProperty -Path "HKLM:\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\FVE" -Name "ADBackedUp" -Value 1 -Type DWord
```

### 2. Intune

```powershell
# In Intune:
# Devices → Configuration profiles → Create → Endpoint protection → BitLocker

# Enable key escrow
# Settings: Select "Store recovery keys in Intune"
```

### 3. Azure AD

Automatically backed up when:
- Device is Azure AD joined
- User has correct licenses

## How to Recover Keys

### From Intune

1. Go to **Microsoft Endpoint Manager**
2. **Devices** → **All devices**
3. Select the device
4. Click **BitLocker recovery keys**

```powershell
# Via Graph API
Get-MgDeviceManagementManagedDeviceBitLockerRecoveryKey -ManagedDeviceId $DeviceID
```

### From Active Directory

```powershell
# Using ADUC (Active Directory Users and Computers)
# View → Advanced Features
# Find computer object → Properties → BitLocker Recovery tab
```

### From Backup (8-digit ID)

If user has the 8-digit numerical ID:

```powershell
# In Intune recovery blade
# Enter the 8-digit ID to retrieve the key
```

## Automating Key Backup

### Script: Export Keys to SharePoint

```powershell
<#
.SYNOPSIS
    Export BitLocker keys to CSV
#>

$OutputFile = "$env:TEMP\BitLockerKeys_$(Get-Date -Format 'yyyyMMdd').csv"

# Get all devices with BitLocker
$Devices = Get-MgDeviceManagementManagedDevice -Filter "bitLockerEnabled eq true" -All

$Results = @()

foreach ($Device in $Devices) {
    $Keys = Get-MgDeviceManagementManagedDeviceBitLockerRecoveryKey -ManagedDeviceId $Device.Id -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue
    
    foreach ($Key in $Keys) {
        $Results += [PSCustomObject]@{
            DeviceName = $Device.DeviceName
            DeviceID = $Device.AzureADDeviceID
            KeyID = $Key.Id
            RecoveryKey = $Key.BitLockerRecoveryKey
            CreatedDate = $Key.CreatedDateTime
        }
    }
}

$Results | Export-Csv -Path $OutputFile -NoTypeInformation
Write-Host "Exported to: $OutputFile"
```

## Preventing Lockouts

### 1. Save Recovery Keys EARLY

```powershell
# Script to save key during encryption
$tpm = Get-Tpm
if ($tvm.TpmPresent -and $tpm.TpmReady) {
    Enable-BitLocker -MountPoint "C:" -EncryptionMethod XtsAes256 -UsedSpaceOnly -TpmProtector
    
    # Save recovery key locally as backup
    $Key = Get-BitLockerVolume -MountPoint "C:" | Select-Object -ExpandProperty KeyProtector | Where-Object { $_.KeyProtectorType -eq "RecoveryPassword" }
    
    # Export to secure location
    $Key.RecoveryPassword | Out-File "C:\BitLocker\$env:USERNAME-Recovery.txt"
}
```

### 2. Configure TPM Properly

```powershell
# Check TPM status
Get-Tpm

# Clear TPM if needed (WARNING: may cause BitLocker to require recovery)
Clear-Tpm -AllowClear
```

### 3. Set Up MBAM (Microsoft BitLocker Administration and Monitoring)

For larger enterprises, MBAM provides:
- Self-service portal
- Admin key recovery
- Compliance reporting

## Common Errors

### "The operation could not be completed because the BitLocker protection software could not be enabled"

- Disable Secure Boot temporarily
- Check TPM is enabled in BIOS
- Update chipset/BIOS firmware

### "This PC doesn't support BitLocker"

- Check TPM version (must be 1.2+)
- Check if Pro/Enterprise edition
- Check Group Policy blocking

## Quick Checklist

- [ ] Keys backed up to AD or Intune
- [ ] Users know their 8-digit ID
- [ ] Self-service recovery portal configured
- [ ] Documented recovery process for helpdesk
- [ ] Test recovery before you need it

## Wrap-Up

BitLocker recovery keys are not optional in enterprise. Back them up, test recovery, and have a process.
