# Intune Device Restriction Profiles Explained

Device restriction profiles in Intune are one of the most powerful tools for securing your endpoints. This guide walks through each setting and when to use it.

## What Are Device Restriction Profiles?

They're Intune configuration profiles that control:
- Device hardware
- Windows features
- Security settings
- App installation
- Network access

## Creating a Profile

1. Go to **Microsoft Endpoint Manager**
2. **Devices** → **Configuration profiles**
3. **Create profile** → **Windows 10 and later**
4. Select **Device restrictions**

## Settings Explained

### 1. General

| Setting | Options | Recommendation |
|---------|---------|----------------|
| Camera | Allow/Block | Allow (or block if sensitive) |
| Removable storage | Allow/Block | Allow (audit) |
| Wi-Fi | Allow/Block | Allow |
| Bluetooth | Allow/Block | Allow (or disable if no BT needed) |

### 2. Password

| Setting | Value | Notes |
|---------|-------|-------|
| Password required | Enable | Required |
| Minimum password length | 14+ | NIST recommendation |
| Password type | Alphanumeric | Stronger |
| Password age (days) | 60 | Rotate regularly |
| Remember password history | 24 | Don't reuse |

```powershell
# Example: Force password complexity via Graph
$Profile = @{
    "@odata.type" = "#microsoft.graph.windows10DeviceGeneralConfiguration"
    passwordRequired = $true
    passwordMinimumLength = 14
    passwordRequiredType = "alphanumeric"
    passwordPreviousPasswordBlockCount = 24
}
```

### 3. Account Protection

- **Windows Hello for Business**: Enable
- ** TPM**: Require TPM 2.0
- **Anti-theft mode**: Enable

### 4. Store

- **Auto-update apps**: Enable
- **Store**: Allow (or disable for locked-down)

### 5. Windows Defender SmartScreen

- **SmartScreen for Edge**: Require
- **Warn about potentially dangerous apps**: Enable

### 6. Network and Communications

| Setting | Recommendation |
|---------|----------------|
| IPv6 forwarding | Disable |
| Network bridge | Disable (unless needed) |
| Wi-Fihotspot 2.0 | Enable |

## Endpoint Security vs Device Configuration

### Device Configuration
- Day-to-day settings
- User-facing controls
- More granular

### Endpoint Security
- Security baselines
- Hardening templates
- Attack surface reduction

## Example: High-Security Profile

```json
{
  "passwordRequired": true,
  "passwordMinimumLength": 16,
  "passwordComplexity": "strong",
  "cameraBlocked": true,
  "storageBlockRemovableStorage": true,
  "defenderSmartScreenEnabled": true,
  "firewallEnabled": true,
  "windowsHelloRequired": true,
  "tpmRequired": true
}
```

## Deployment

1. Create profile
2. Assign to groups
3. Monitor compliance

```powershell
# Check compliance status
Get-MgDeviceManagementDeviceConfiguration -Filter "displayName eq 'High Security'"
```

## Wrap-Up

Device restriction profiles are your primary tool for securing Windows endpoints. Start with basics and harden over time.
